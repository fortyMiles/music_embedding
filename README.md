Supervisor: Prof Zhang Kejun, Zhejiang University, Computer Science 

This research project explored the music generation by giving ancient Chinese lyrics. In this project, I was responsible for the following:  

•	Built Character Embedding for lyrics to make their semantic similarity could be calculated
•	Designed and implemented music note span embedding inspired by word embedding, which could generate a huge set of music sound elements and could calculate the acoustic similarity and coherence
•	Designed and implemented Seq2Seq with attention model to generate music elements by giving lyrics
+ The generated sampling you can listen in:
